# Integration Service

A .NET 10 service that sits between DevLake and third-party systems such as Sophia and Workstream. The design is in `integration-service-architecture-plan.md` (PR #140).

## Layout

Each layer references only the layer directly below it.

| Project | Role |
|---|---|
| `Arbisoft.DevLake.IntegrationService.API` | Controllers, authorization, rate limiting, background jobs |
| `Arbisoft.DevLake.IntegrationService.Web` | Razor Pages admin portal |
| `Arbisoft.DevLake.IntegrationService.Business` | Services, DTOs, token and encryption logic |
| `Arbisoft.DevLake.IntegrationService.DataAccess` | Models, Dapper repositories, SQL migrations (DbUp), external API clients, RabbitMQ |
| `Arbisoft.DevLake.IntegrationService.UnitTests` | xUnit tests |

Deviations from the team's .NET guidelines are recorded in `dotnet-dev.exceptions.md`.

## Run locally

Start MySQL (port 3308) and RabbitMQ (ports 5672 and 15672):

```sh
cp env.example .env   # then edit the values
docker compose up -d
```

Settings live in each project's `appsettings.json`. Secrets are never put there. Set them as environment variables, using `__` for nesting:

```sh
export Database__ConnectionString="Server=127.0.0.1;Port=3308;Database=integration;User=integration;Password=<password>"
export RabbitMq__UserName=<user> RabbitMq__Password=<password>
export DevLake__ApiToken=<token> Workstream__ApiToken=<token>
dotnet run --project Arbisoft.DevLake.IntegrationService.API
```

The host refuses to start if a required setting is missing. Health endpoints: `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.

## Build and test

```sh
dotnet build -warnaserror
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
dotnet test
```

CI runs the same steps plus a vulnerable-package check (`.github/workflows/integration-service.yml`).
